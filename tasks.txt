    var carName = "Volvo";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carname;
4. Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables x and y.
5. Create a third variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display it.
    var x = 5;
    var y = 10;
6. Use a single var keyword to create three variables with the following values: 
    firstName = "John" 
    lastName = "Doe" 
    age = 35

    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 
    firstName + " " + lastName + " is " + age;

== Arithmetics ==
1. Display the product of 10 * 5, using two variables x and y.
2. Find the remainder when 15 is divided by 9, using two variables x and y.
3. Use the += operator to add a value of 5 to the variable x.
4. Use the %= operator to assign a remainder of 10 / 3 to the variable x.

== Functions ==
1. Create and call a function.
2. Use the function to display the product of 5 * 5.
3. Use the function to display "Hello John".
4. Define a function named "myFunction", and make it display "Hello World!" in the <p> element.

== Objects ==
1. Display "John" by extracting information from the person object.
    var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};
2. Create an object called person with name = John, age = 50. Then, access the object to display "John is 50 years old".

=== Events ==
1. The <p> element should do something when someone clicks on it.
2. When the button is clicked, trigger myFunction() with an event.

== Strings ==
